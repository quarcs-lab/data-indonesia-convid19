The coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreaks that led to a serious health crisis has brought major disruptions on the economy in many countries, including Indonesia. Firstly identified in early March 2020, the pandemic has started to affect Indonesian economy in Q1-2020. Yet the situation is even worse in Q2-2020. How bad is that? This publication is intended to explore the economic impacts of Covid-19 pandemic across Indonesian provinces from Q1 to Q2-2020. Apart from Covid-19 cases and economic growth data, we also include jobs and community mobility data from Google to capture the impact of Covid-19 outbreaks on regional employment and people mobility.

```

Most of provinces recorded negative growth rate in Q2-2020. However, some provinces were able to maintain positive growth rate. They are West Papua and Papua (for yoy growth) and West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, Papua, Central Sulawesi (for qtq growth).


#  How economic structure is related to growth impact in Q2-2020?

  tm_layout(legend.title.size = 0.6,
          legend.text.size = 0.5,
          legend.position = c("left","bottom"))
```

Provinces like Bali, Yogyakarta and Jakarta with higher share of transportation, tourism and services sector in GDP suffer larger negative impact in growth.
